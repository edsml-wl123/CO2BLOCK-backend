# CO2BLOCK: A tool for estimates of storage resource capacity in saline aquifers

CO2BLOCK provides the automatic estimate of the storage capacity of an aquifer, based on the geomechanical limits to pressure build-up. 

Users only need to open and modify the script "CO2BLOCK.m". There is no need to open or modify the other scripts, which is instead not recommended.

Please refer to the user guide for more detailed instructions.
